

0.8.3 changes so far:       [remember to actually test all these]
feat advancement changed
spell learning changed
bow ammo added - last arrow gets a base accuracy of 100%
wandering monster spawns (with escalating difficulty)
enemies no longer devastate the player when their sneak attack scores a critical hit
fear changed: no longer prevents movement when all destinations are equally frightening - this means you can slip past a terrifying enemy and keep running. Also added visual indicator.
confusion status effect added. given to dream warrior on crit.
burning now deals 2 or 3 damage each turn, instead of 1d6.
major/minor damage, changes to bandages, vulnerability, some new immunities and shielded statuses. (minor damage mostly includes damage over time: poison, bleeding, burning, searing heat, infestation, acid...)
bleeding status added, given to swordsman on combo
damage resistance given to several enemies. stoneform potions also grant some DR.
robed zealot reworked
silence aura guys print a message when they step nearby (with cooldown and LOE check)
more likely to spawn more than 1 "shallow" monster on deeper levels
bugfix: staff swapping places while immobile
let frog affect all weapons (what's the chance on each hit?) but give Poisoned weapons a chance to poison their user - maybe when you attack, maybe something else.
slight tweak to gas behavior - new gas now replaces old gas. no more mixing.
marble horror reworked: gains bleeding attack, heals to full when it transforms, avoids light.
changes to several monsters, and a few new ones
monsters with noneuclidean movement now ignore slippery surfaces and webs
dodge mechanic added to several monsters
assassin becomes stealth+dodge+lunge+silence.
bloodwitch's radius decreased
ogre barbarian added
fixed a bug where throwing a monster into the ceiling with telekinesis could cause a crash
fixed a bug where whirlwind style could fail to activate when using the staff or while under the effects of a potion of brutish strength
zombie's bite attack can now grab its target.
fixed a bug where font scaling or custom DPI settings could cause display and mouse input problems.
bugfix: using dust storm (fog too?) on a firepit removes its light!  ...but this is basically new anyway so doesn't need to be mentioned.
shadowveil duelist replaced with sneak thief
luminous avenger reworked
darkness dweller's light sensitivity changed a little.
blood moth is now attracted to any lit tile if it can't see an actual light source
-and monsters should flash onscreen when they attack the player, if the player is blind?
casters don't seem to care about SILENCED, only SILENCE_AURA.
intelligent creatures douse themselves?
burning deals less damage per turn but lasts longer. About the same total damage, but you've got longer to run over to that pool of water...
drive back buffed: now also doubles crit chance if the target can't get away.
improved targeting for orbs that should make tricky placement easier.
fixed a bug where even mindless creatures would often avoid hazardous terrain
spell fail system changed - 15% is no longer a lot of exhaustion to a caster. This brings spells more in line with armor & weapon interactions.
make the game not crash if highscores are missing
instead of calculating the flee map each turn, make the player CLEAR it each turn. then the first fleeing monster each turn will check for it and create it.
right and middle click now work on the map screen: inventory and [v]iew more commands.
knockback messages streamlined
fog/dust storm should add the fog/dust to the last-known map, since you see the animation.
hidden doors in fortresses are really easy to spot...
make scrolls check (when placed/thrown into a tile) for burning actors as well as fire in the tile - this'll let you toss scrolls to keep a burning enemy lit.
fixed a bug where mouseover descriptions sometimes didn't clear properly
steal the sleeping -> dormant thing from crawl, and let all sleep effects work on everything.
fixed a bug where monsters could sometimes find the player too easily when invisible
anything without humanoid int shouldn't avoid gases - better handling of hazards in general
take the invis mechanic from delusions - when you leave a tile while invisible, any adjacent monstahs know where you went, IF they're alerted.
amnesia duration increased to make it better for non-stealthy characters compared to stealthy ones
let staff destroy skeletons too? Should I have *no* weapon-specific stuff, and just go with blunt/edged?
also make more traps affect items. throw something on that teleport trap? awesome, now go find it.
and make flint degrade when thrown, too.
make your last score always visible in high scores
explosions and other knockback effects will now properly consider the source of the damage
being in water when it freezes could (should!) immobilize you briefly.
wait, setting a monster on fire doesn't burn existing webs?
you can trap a monster with pathing weirdness: if you make noise on a wall, it'll keep trying to step there. if it never sees or hears you after that, it'll stay.
monsters can still try to path to rubble forever. (because they step around it rather than scattering it) - related to above bug?
collapse should make noise
tripping should exhaust a bit.
fixed a bug where you were unable to tumble through fog
minor: smashing a monster into a wall could leave a blood splatter. only if they die?
make the cloud elemental's attack reveal its position?
the skeleton falls with your arrow between its eyes? fixed.
decide between fairy and faerie
make blast fungus ignite when you pull them up, instead of being impossible.
unstable teleportals will now transport items away, too - make that exploding blast fungus someone else's problem!
can [x] be ignored if autoexploring?
firing an arrow through fire should catch it - this can be used as a key.
whoa, hold on, do they actually avoid the fire? FIX THIS.
improved monsters' ability to avoid traffic jams while pathing
"bandages have no effect on you in stone form"
make poltergeist appear after fewer events
does adding a troll corpse to a firepit create fire? it should! - also fixed a bug with troll corpses
danger sense obscures lit/unlit, which is annoying.
ghosts might not spawn again IMMEDIATELY if you're still standing there
drive back is cool but auto hits are way too easy to get ANYWAY - simply add an awesome bonus. -now doubles crit, right?



vvvvv





























expand message buffer
	-mostly straightforward, but we should only print the last few, not ALL of them, when the game loads.
	-allow scrolling, but only if there are non-blank messages.

list?  things that need to be done with the previous messages:

-find the last message
-change last message if repeated
-add new messages to end
-(no longer needs to loop until we have tons of messages)


...so, i'm thinking I keep the same system, with array, but also track how many actual messages have been created. this'll let me NOT save thousands of blanks, and also let me restrict scrolling.







TODO:











more grab bug info: Mimic grabs.  Hit mimic with mace.  Mimic is knocked back.  Grenade knocks me back toward mimic, or I just step there (same direction).  Mimic is now holding me again despite not grabbing me.

"Possessed  Poisoned"   <--these lines should probably be centered, not offset to the left.

whatever orb-targeting change you made to fix the cursor appearing, do the same thing to arrow firing.

you should be able to look around in 'm'ap like you do in 'X'.
	-this would require another (map-only) look mode.

improve [m]ap with shrine info and maybe stairs discovered and maybe turns spent on this level.

add "or yourself" to TK's description  -  what, in the help file?

remember to update entrancer list, wandering spawn list, etc.

do a lot of playtesting and then consider Knowledge at rarity 1 vs. rarity 2.

oil and slime washing:  if you can [o]perate it to coat yourself, then I can't let it appear in the water. It seems to be one or the other.

maybe make arcane interference always reduce enemy mana or something? even when they don't have that spell, right?
	-look at this again after you can check out the description. make sure it'll all fit.

autoexplore still has bugs: it's willing to become drowsy in poppies even though an EQUAL path avoids them.
	-not reproduced

"blast everything with magic" might be too viable right now, if you don't run out of mana quick enough.
	-this makes me consider lower HP enemies, but more of them. But then, I was going to rebalance all the HP values upward. how should I resolve this?

autoexplore is still trying to go through this stone slab?!?  it's not a trap room. I guess it needs a much higher cost or something?
	-cost of slab increased. test this.


#                                                      #
# remember to use some colored walls in here somewhere #
#                                                      #

add two more pages to monster descriptions: Abilities (spells out exactly what they do) and Tips (gives tactical hints)

tutorial tips for a bunch of the less obvious commands? map, known, travel, walk, operate, explore...

make terrain descriptions appear in lookmode

make the "use ranged attacks against this enemy!" tip WAY more blunt.

do i have a tip for exhaustion yet? (when does it appear?)

add tutorial tip for "ancient power calling you back" - this needs to be obvious

option for 'safe mode' that prevents 'y,y' for prompts and ignores key repeat? (is that part even possible?)

conditional printing of corpse knockback message - maybe save the message in reserve,
	and print it only if something else happens that could cause a message.

"you can no longer see this %item%" might be a problem - if I print its name, it reveals that it's still there. If I ignore it, you can't travel to it. If I don't want to reveal that it's still there, I have to remember it somehow.



not reproduced reliably:
BUG: this has happened several times now. After entering Help, keyboard commands are sometimes ignored.

mapgen:
firepits should generate sometimes in fortresses after all - sometimes near barrels.
add giant glowing fungus
	-spawns in fungus patches, of course.  blocks movement and LOS? They don't NEED to do anything else. (could also trample like foliage, or release spores)
do I add doors before altering rooms in standard levels? that can lead to doors in the middle of corridors when cross rooms are involved. (if this becomes a problem, i think the easiest solution is a separate scan for stray doors)
	-not reproduced - did i disable some code in level gen?
crypt levels seem to be disconnected more often than most 
  -if anything is disconnected right now, the bug is in RemoveUnconnected() itself.
for the unconnected level thing, it might not be alterrooms after all. I got one that called RemoveUnconnected, then RemoveDeadEnds, then MarkInteresting, and it still happened, so the problem is in one of those two, or in removeunconnected itself.



REMEMBER TO CHECK FUTURE_TODO AGAIN! THERE'S PLENTY LEFT IN THERE.
































to try:

do a random walk algo, but once in a while let the shape of the walker change. so, it'd start as 1x1 but might connect new ones to itself, or remove them:
# to ## to ## to # and so on...
            #    #






TODO: SEE ALL-CAPS NOTE BELOW!

ignoring the fact that I don't have a set with all the graphics I need just yet...

what would I need for this?

first, I know I need some sort of thing to keep track of the current screen position, horizontally only. This will be used when the player moves, in lookmode, and other stuff like that.


then, i need texcoords for every graphic...


when I get graphical mode working, i'll need to change the mouse handler to check for that.


will I still support font changes for non-graphical mode? sounds good. i suppose graphical mode might be restricted to one font, so switching to graphics would resize the screen or whatever.
	-when graphical mode is enabled, we've gotta go back to whatever the default is. 

NEXT: figure out how to do this^ to switch back to the default size when graphics are enabled, and also do map scrolling in graphics mode.

well, i can ignore it in fullscreen, so that's nice. switching to ASCII mode is no problem: the only question is whether I should remember the previous size. (don't bother for now.) so, graphics -> ASCII requires no resize.

all that's left is ASCII->graphics while the screen is anything but the default.

(and now, just gotta disable resizing in graphical mode)


ah, gotta check the previous size when un-fullscreening, too. (so, if the graphics were turned on while fullscreened, you can detect that and resize the screen to the proper graphics size.)
	-this should probably happen in the overridden keyhandler, not in GL.


BUG FOUND: in GenerateFloorTypes, line ~3605, there's no bounds check. I don't know how this hasn't crashed yet.


check for 'disable graphics' on game start, too, and disable if needed.

maybe make graphics_disabled a global bool (too?) to avoid dictionary access.


note: i added parabola and schism to the project. didn't add the build script or opentk.dll.






monodevelop crashes seem to have vanished. knock on wood.



todo: while fixing map scrolling in graphics mode, make sure to add a gradual scroll. When you teleport across the map, it should move once, then draw, then move again, then draw, and so on until it gets to your new position.
























done:
command line switch to start console version as GL.
I used the wrong form of current_level when spawning monsters in sliding wall traps. as a result, corpsetower behemoths can appear very early.
frostling freeze needs LOS/cansee check.
every instance of AI_Step(safe.Random()) in entrancer AI can crash the game with a nullref. check for safe.Count > 0.
haha, skulking killers can throw bolas through walls.
entrancer AI could use some fixes - it's still willing to teleport its thrall from a spot that blocks your shot to a spot that doesn't.
i fixed that infinite loop with a shrine and interesting_location SOMEWHERE - I think i fixed it in the GL version, so make sure this gets changed everywhere.
shrines probably shouldn't be within 2 tiles of other shrines unless paired - it's probably confusing
if pendant is now chance-based, make the description match.
re-enable attempted terminal fix
i broke telekinesis - can't throw barrels. (also fixed crash bug with extended targeting lines not being used)
orbs of shielding reveal actors present.
if chardump has no extension, add .txt?
offer "known item types" on death?
don't do the "trying consumables" tip if the player knew several item types but had some unknown ones in the pack - they might have been using them!
make web clusters bigger
some ranged attacks shouldn't leave the attacker off-balance, like the alasi scout. (could become an ability and not an attack, but it's cool both ways)
when a corpse(or anything else) is knocked through a door, it still prints "the foo opens the door"
light trap (and probably others) use the_name instead of TheName(true)
maybe the shadow shouldn't be able to damage your armor for some reason? it can be nasty. (perhaps the attack needs at least 2 dice)
dim vision now almost blinds you in darkness (hmmmm)
monsters should sidestep traps when not chasing you! if you see them do it (because you're stealthed) then you'll know where the trap is.
	-not actually walking around it, but "the foo avoids a %trap%."
monsters will dance around rubble instead of going through it. (big piles of rubble, that is)
additional attacks to make combo attacks more obvious. (alasi soldier is fine though)
phase spiders respond to sounds by pathing there. i thought i had fixed that.
print a message when a weak point activates! just like for armor blocking hits.
new symbol for blast fungus?
check melee damage of oozes - they shouldn't be too threatening just with melee damage.
	-changed back to 3
enemy arrows previously couldn't score critical hits to pin.
immunity to fire damage at 5 boiling blood stacks.
problem with corner climb + doors: the doors must be at a diagonal, otherwise it'll activate at the end of a corridor with an open door in front of you.
ghosts sometimes choose to step out of range of tombstones and vanish. (might not be fixed)
fix message "you can't read scrolls while silenced" where auras are concerned.
burning monsters currently get a message in calculateDimming(), and dimming can sometimes last for the entire level
you still 'walk straight into' shadow-cloaked monsters after seeing them.
collapse should break items like the rubble trap does.
scorch isn't actually a damaging spell. stone spikes is. collapse, too.
stalagmite hit doesn't work on enough floor types yet.
amnesiac monsters should lose AMNESIA_STUN upon taking damage
add '.' wait to the command list
should !oSilence give you an aura? (so the guy you're fighting doesn't make noise either)
	-do this, and then tweak caster AI so they flee while silenced & at full health.
"the ghost notices you" message spam. it's wandering around and I'm far away out of LOS. same as the warmage bug, i think - distance doesn't seem to matter, though. the message stops when you enter LOS.
you can be oiled and stoneformed at the same time, which leads to constant "you catch fire!" messages if you're near fire.
-brutish strength knockback should happen instead of drive back, right?
-make grabs interact with frozen - frozen probably breaks & prevents grabs.
-"The grenade explodes! A noxious worm bursts through the wall! [more" <--the cursor was of course on the next row down, and the 'e' remained on the screen.
-make sure burning enemies *advance* out of fire when possible, toward the player.
(improved AI for handling hazardous terrain)
-and, of course, AI could check the danger value of the tile it's about to walk into...
give mindless to phase spider, or make it teleport away here, too? (made phase spider avoid hazards by teleporting, too)
equipment screen colors "[a]" entirely in cyan. consider changing.
bug: "You is no longer pinned." ...haha. Glad I found that one.
bug: you become magical_drowsiness
-some walls could become dark gray now that i use blue for out of sight, eh? (fortress changed to dark gray)
-allow game to be started with no options.txt and highscore.txt
crypts + naturally generated tombstones can put them too close together
allow looking around the map after death?
"you fade away in the darkness" should also appear when you put your torch away while shadow cloaked.
-poppies shouldn't be hazardous if you're already drowsy or can't escape them anyway.
-low chance to find a chest in a sliding wall trap?
-flush input after more animations, especially passage. -- and bola!
-disable mouse pathing while [more] is displayed - otherwise, you zoom off across the map after it clears.
-monsters seem to EITHER continue down corridors OR continue down paths after seeing the player (if the player ducks out of LOS). THEN they go to the target_location. (I added path.Clear())
-brambles don't cost enough yet, or else autoexplore isn't considering them:
-perhaps a bigger penalty than -1 for each fork in the road when corridor-seeking?
kobold(poison ticks for Q5),
ahh, autoexplore pathing IS broken - it's trying to reach the nearest ones even if it goes over traps. (should be fixed - it was considering traps as valid if they were next to unexplored space)
-consider flight for exploration pathing
no IMMOBILIZATION of flying enemies with arrows, i think - no, keep this, but make them trigger traps when they get pinned. \o/
plus, roots should end flying, but that's probably not needed because it'll outlast it. - no need, but make this trigger traps too.
-hmm - double clicking [w]alk makes you (usually) walk to the left. Might need to disable that if you're outside the map.
-make double clicking [w] and [X] cancel - send an Escape if you're outside the map.
-hacky [s]hoot button added to targeting mode.
consider reminder for "you can't move!" (x520)
change freeze trap message to avoid double "encased in ice"
reminder if you've missed a shrine when taking stairs? -needs a good message
another lighting bug: I found a 2x3 (buggy) darkened section against a wall. might have been caused by a cultist lighting itself (and updating its radius) despite being slime-covered or something. - i don't know if this is fixed, but I did finally add a slime check for cultists
option for confirmation before resting
-I need to make a method to unify all the tile costs, and consider player-only stuff too.
maybe move lashers or oozes to depth 8, and move pixies to depth 9 (and have them appear in groups) - also changed their crit effect.
oh wow, lashers retaliate for every point of fire damage. hmmmm.
...i just realized that you can read scrolls while blind
drop how many? barely works with mouse.
item bug: It's possible to have a (stack of) scroll(s) in the inventory that "you don't know what type this is". check all methods of item acquisition.
the "you feel less vulnerable" message still appears if it has triggered.
	-should be easy to clear those events
bug: some trinkets don't get buttons - all of them after the first?
there's another bug with the character screen buttons. When I had only a few feats, it was fine, but after it wrapped to the next line the button extended across the entire line.
hmm...double clicking Descend will confirm "really descend without resting?".
whoa, utility.cs is missing from the project.
"The skeleton looks less disoriented. " - no skeleton in sight.

done^







-write cave corridor & twisty cave article for RB. also possibly dijkstra maps part 2 with screenshots.
-in fact, make a dijkstra visualizer. see distances by number and/or by color. Add or multiply different maps, and change them in realtime.
