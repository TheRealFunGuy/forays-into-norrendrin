-broke save/load, of course

rework collapse

okay. maybe i shouldn't allow the conflict between collapse and stone spikes?

collapse is good for going through walls; stone spikes is good for blocking LOS?

maybe this:

the target tile and adjacent floors become gravel.
walls adjacent to the target become either rubble or cracked walls.



update help files 
	-update collapse again

fix autopickup

fix runmode stopping

"you feel comfortable in your %ARMOR again" when exhaustion drops.

message for every new monster! -whoops

fix ghost - perhaps by removing its seek and idle

make darkness kill avengers, make cold devastate slugs, ditto freezing


include a goal at the start	-	"None of the other scouts returned." etc

check every new class member and make sure it gets cleared between games if needed.


check highscore, option, name files. verify correct version on other help files.


-make 'trailer' vid
-remember to remove the hallucination & fire test videos from screencast
-email LPers and article author too



update roguebasin entry: remove coffeebreak designation.

-write cave corridor & twisty cave article for RB. also possibly dijkstra maps part 2 with screenshots.

bugs: 
If you move to a new level and end up in the same spot, the map will lose track of you until you move because the position is cleared last.

here's that really weird one where I got killed the turn I used a rune of time:
"Time stops for a moment. (grayed out)
You bring out your torch. The troll seer regenerates. The troll
seer casts glacial blast. The glacial blast hits you. You [more]
die. [more]"

visual bug for lightning bolt: when targeting past the target to hit it at an angle (when it's in a doorway, say), the bolt seems to go through walls.

"The skeleton looks less disoriented. " - no skeleton in sight.
	-reviewed code. should never happen, but it did.
		-theory: it died and the message was still printed. rework removal from msg_obj list.
			-happened again with "the skeleton looks more stable". debug the trap messages, then do the msg_obj fix.
		-above theory is probably wrong: happened with a goblin that was alive
			-yeah, this still happens. maybe the bug is in the 'forget about dead things' code in event.
