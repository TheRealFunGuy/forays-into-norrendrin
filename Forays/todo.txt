things to do between 0.5 and 1.0:

20 dungeon levels, with an appropriate number of monsters and items

at least 1 special level per game, with an appropriate number of different special levels

animations should support the concept of a 'viewer' - cells outside viewer's FOV don't animate.

if lashers happen to need balancing: their tentacles could miss adjacent targets more often, or deal less damage to them


things to do somewhere between 0.1 and 1.0:

perhaps enemies that you sneak attack should have a chance of yelling in surprise

remove stealthy flag from goblin

piercing/slashing/bashing are still 'normal' damage...

and some elemental attacks are magical...



...
...



20 monsters +
troll
necromancer
cultist
	-something for cultists to summon - this should be on a special level though, and it would be badass.
		-summoning circles and all
poltergeist (uncommon)
	-throws objects, slams doors(which the player will hear and investigate), shrieks, ...
	-if you stay in its area for a certain amount of time, it manifests:
		-gray or green 'G'
		-i want it to retain some of its annoying qualities. perhaps a short period of time where it moves randomly and
			is hard to hit or damage for some reason. oh, it should laugh while doing this of course.

dream warrior
	-spawns several 'clones' with 1hp and a NO_EXP flag, and a 0-damage attack. maybe some kind of mental suggestion attack?

skulking killer. dark blue 'p'. normal speed probably. stealthy. when it gets close enough, it will (once) throw either a bola to slow you, or (something else) to stun you and deal a small amount of damage. definitely prowls the level.

-next, i need to figure out how attacking/being attacked interacts with the 'turns seen' number.
	-once you sneak attack them, their player_seen number is set to -1.
	-once they sneak attack you, their TURNS_VISIBLE is set to -1.




building offense shouldn't be the beat-all strategy: feats are pretty important.
i already know that i need a few monsters that make Spirit more important. (and don't care a lot how much damage you do?)

so, more early TACTICAL enemies. scarecrow, archer, zombie are probably acceptable for this, but i am actually lacking some.
that is, more enemies that give the player choices. enemies that just dps you don't contribute to this at all.


berserker. red or dark red 'p'. normal speed. two abilities:
	-when brought below 0hp, does not die for 2-3 turns
	-raging axe attack: each turn for 2-3 turns(?), takes a step forward and attacks the 3 spaces ahead.
		-perhaps the first turn is the 'windup' turn, to avoid having another monster that lunges.
(don't fight these guys in a corridor)


swordsman. blue/white/gray 'p'. normal speed. each attack the swordsman makes boosts his bonus combat skill. this bonus is reset when you make a melee attack against him (or if he goes back to idle).
(if you're not engaging him in swordplay, he'll cut you up)
	-the swordsman's stance becomes more aggressive!
		or
	-the swordsman adopts a more aggressive stance!
		or
	-the swordsman switches to a more aggressive stance!
	-...
	-the swordsman returns to a defensive stance.


shade/shadow/ shadow (foo). dark blue or dark gray or black...something... Two abilities:
	- Reduces the light level in nearby tiles. Won't enter lit tiles. Takes damage while in lit tiles.
		-could also simply reduce your light radius as it gets closer...at distance 10 it reduces by 1, at distance 7
			by 2, at distance 5 by 3, at distance 3 by 4, and at distance 2 by 5. then BAM IT'S ON YOU.
			-this actually seems better AND gives another use for Shine. better in the following ways:
				-you don't know from which way it's coming
				-better paranoia messages
				-it looks better too
	- some kind of supernatural effect, amirite?

shadow. dark blue/dark gray 'G' probably. Three abilities:
	-Regenerates while in darkness. (maybe!)
	-Reduces the light radius of the player and other monsters as it approaches.
	12		-1/12		6						11		or just *doubled*	12
		10	-1/6		5						10(visible)				10
	8		-3/12		5	.	.	.	.	.	9	.	.	.	.	10
		7	-2/6		4						8					8
	6		-5/12		4	.	.	.	.	.	7	.	.	.	.	8
		5	-3/6		3						6					6
	4		-7/12		3	.	.	.	.	.	5	.	.	.	.	6
		3	-4/6		2(you now see it just outside your light rad)	4					4
		2	-5/6		1						2					2
	1		-11/12		1						1					2
	-Its attack causes dimness of vision: natural sight range will be reduced to 1/3 of its normal value for 20 + 2d20 turns.



a grenade throwing monster would be pretty interesting, wouldn't it? it would throw fairly inaccurate grenades at you, which would take 1 turn to explode. So, if they landed right on you, you'd get hurt on the next turn, but they'd hit pretty much any square near you.
	-knockback? =-o

-a ranged monster with an ability that is affected by Spirit(a magical, mental, or supernatural ability with a duration).

room mimic
	-how is this going to work? perhaps it's usually generated at the end of a longish corridor, so blinking out is harder to do.
	-it shouldn't ACTUALLY prevent teleportation escapes, though. a quick Passage out is probably just the thing.
	-perhaps some kind of interactive 'don't stand here' thing.
	-so, the event checks every several turns to see if the player is within its area(which is the entire room)
	-if this happens, it either sets some state, or spawns another event type to check again a few turns later(remember, there's a chest in here)
		-how about a good chance of an extra item or two, as well?
			-EITHER 1d3 items OR a chest?
		-wait, why not trigger on the chest, also? both will work great.
	-when the mimic has been disturbed, a message is printed, the membrane/door starts to close, and acid starts to fall.
		-and some of the walls and floor turn to red?
	-i think the average distance from chest to door will be like 3, so probably 2d2 turns.
	-if the player is on the door when it closes, he takes some damage and becomes immobilized. (and can then escape)
	-otherwise, the door becomes a membrane (would be great if certain terrain had ATTACKABLE flag, yeah?) with an okay amount of HP.
	-all the while, every 1d3 turns acid drops onto the floor from the ceiling - this is delayed by 1 turn, so it doesn't hit the player directly.
		-lasts for 1d3+3 turns or so
	-standing in the acid deals damage, of course.
	-ALSO, to prevent the player from simply dancing around until he gets out...the room should probably either shrink, or be subject to an area attack.
		-a crushing attack is way easier. lowish damage, i suppose.
	-annnnd, when the player escapes, the membrane soon returns to its door form and the walls and floors to their normal colors.

	-first, i need terrain for acid and membrane, no problem.
	-and an event for 'spawn acid here', no prob
	-now, what state do i need to track? the event already tracks the area, no problem.
		-'player inside room' - the first trigger. unneeded if i trigger only on the chest.
		-state for 'disturbed', of course
		-'number of turns until membrane closes'
		-state for membrane: closing, crushing, closed.
		-'number of turns until next acid attack'
		-'number of turns until next crushing attack'
		-'membrane has been destroyed' - could also just mean it's dead, and remove the event.
