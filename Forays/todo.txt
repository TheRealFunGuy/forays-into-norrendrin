things to do between 0.5 and 1.0:

at least 1 special level per game, with an appropriate number of different special levels
	-cave of bats

animations should support the concept of a 'viewer' - cells outside viewer's FOV don't animate.

if lashers happen to need balancing: their tentacles could miss adjacent targets more often, or deal less damage to them

generate trolls with rocks they can throw, in a lair, and have them stay in that lair.

consider making ranged attacks...not attacks at all, but generated straight from the AI routine

should group monsters regroup when they can't see the player?

should dream warrior teleport straight to target_location in seekAI?

replace old spell?

shadow should reduce the light radius of zealots, too

if the line is blocked while targeting, perhaps the alternate line could be considered.

quick draw could work like juggler - no need to switch to bow to use it.

buff zealot, probably the holy shield. make it at least 2d6.

arrows that miss should continue...

0.6.0 should have:
things other than the player should be able to call MakeNoise
extend the "monster notices" sounds so that you can hear them even if you can't see them.
if you target past an enemy to hit them, like one often does in doomRL, the animation usually still goes past them.
generate some doors
fully implement help system.
generate rats at start.
drive back should give 100% accuracy against cornered enemies.
add color to spell selection screen
	-anything above 50% fail: dark red.  anything above 20%: red. anything above 0%: yellow. 0%: white(?)
colorize 'active' / 'passive' in feats?
tumble shouldn't start at the nearest enemy. special classification for non-offensive things like this?
allow use of previous skill choice to start.
&&
allow saving of options
&&
high score screen that shows names of most experienced and deepest chars.
examine equipment, items, map and previous messages on death




bugs: 
using lunge on an aware goblin archer a knight's move away. the archer appears normal, when it should have a green background from the targeting.
	-i believe this is another form of the other background color bug.
	-linux or win?
	-does not happen every time. this one might be a pain to track down.
related: targeting cursor is STILL sometimes invisible. just the targeted tile, on windows.
	-a possible hint at the cause? (or did my 'fix' just break something else?): on windows, targeting past walls to the edge of the map. target tile is at the top of the map, and pressing up causes the bright red highlight to TOGGLE on and off! also, if I move the cursor quickly enough, it FLASHES bright red and then goes black.

again on linux - bits of the previous map still appear. no idea why. does not happen often. (once so far!)
	-not reproduced yet
there still might be a bug related to being on fire and catching fire at the same time.
	-not reproduced
"The skeleton looks less disoriented. " - no skeleton in sight.
	-reviewed code. should never happen, but it did.
on the turn that a skulking killer stepped on a grenade trap, I saw "You fire an arrow. The arrow misses the skulking killer. [more]" - the message was in blue. (the [more] was normal)
lashers can still move somehow, probably by pathing.
	-drive back shouldn't work on them




--generate the list of monsters first, THEN generate the level. then verify that i.e. a troll has a proper lair.

poltergeist: spawns as an event with a certain area, sometimes an entire room.
effects:
opens and slams doors in its area
throws items in its area at the player
shrieks loudly to call nearby monsters
laughs(no effect)
if the player sticks around, it'll manifest, after which it occasionally laughs and moves around?
	-this can be made much more complex
		-it would also move away occasionally


cultist
	-something for cultists to summon - this should be on a special level though, and it would be badass.
		-summoning circles and all
poltergeist (uncommon)
	-throws objects, slams doors(which the player will hear and investigate), shrieks, ...
	-if you stay in its area for a certain amount of time, it manifests:
		-gray or green 'G'
		-i want it to retain some of its annoying qualities. perhaps a short period of time where it moves randomly and
			is hard to hit or damage for some reason. oh, it should laugh while doing this of course.


room mimic
	-how is this going to work? perhaps it's usually generated at the end of a longish corridor, so blinking out is harder to do.
	-it shouldn't ACTUALLY prevent teleportation escapes, though. a quick Passage out is probably just the thing.
	-perhaps some kind of interactive 'don't stand here' thing.
	-so, the event checks every several turns to see if the player is within its area(which is the entire room)
	-if this happens, it either sets some state, or spawns another event type to check again a few turns later(remember, there's a chest in here)
		-how about a good chance of an extra item or two, as well?
			-EITHER 1d3 items OR a chest?
		-wait, why not trigger on the chest, also? both will work great.
	-when the mimic has been disturbed, a message is printed, the membrane/door starts to close, and acid starts to fall.
		-and some of the walls and floor turn to red?
	-i think the average distance from chest to door will be like 3, so probably 2d2 turns.
	-if the player is on the door when it closes, he takes some damage and becomes immobilized. (and can then escape)
	-otherwise, the door becomes a membrane (would be great if certain terrain had ATTACKABLE flag, yeah?) with an okay amount of HP.
	-all the while, every 1d3 turns acid drops onto the floor from the ceiling - this is delayed by 1 turn, so it doesn't hit the player directly.
		-lasts for 1d3+3 turns or so
	-standing in the acid deals damage, of course.
	-ALSO, to prevent the player from simply dancing around until he gets out...the room should probably either shrink, or be subject to an area attack.
		-a crushing attack is way easier. lowish damage, i suppose.
	-annnnd, when the player escapes, the membrane soon returns to its door form and the walls and floors to their normal colors.

	-first, i need terrain for acid and membrane, no problem.
	-and an event for 'spawn acid here', no prob
	-now, what state do i need to track? the event already tracks the area, no problem.
		-'player inside room' - the first trigger. unneeded if i trigger only on the chest.
		-state for 'disturbed', of course
		-'number of turns until membrane closes'
		-state for membrane: closing, crushing, closed.
		-'number of turns until next acid attack'
		-'number of turns until next crushing attack'
		-'membrane has been destroyed' - could also just mean it's dead, and remove the event.
