cEc
cEc
	-this won't be used at all until I have nonrectangular rooms


room shapes:
rectangular
  min: 3x3
elliptical
  min: 5x5
diamond
  min: 5x5
triangular
  min: 5x5
L-shaped
  min: 6x6
cross-shaped
  min: 7x7
alcoves(2x2 holes on sides of room)
  min: 9x9

room features:
pillars in various configurations. basic guidelines: no 2 pillars should touch, &
	rooms should be symmetrical in at least one dimension.
	explicit pillar rules! find the dimensions of the 'pillar matrix' - the
	largest arrangement of pillars that can fit in a single(say, the top-left)
	quadrant of a room. Then, fill randomly, respecting the rule "no staggered
	pillars, such as #.  .# ". If the dimension is divisible by 4, you can add an
	offset of 0 or 1 in that dimension. Then, simply reflect to fill the room.
	an 11x11 room has a 3x3 matrix, a 15x22 room has 4x5, and 3x3 has 1x1.
   -don't use the above method just yet. for now, either make 1 pillar in each
	quadrant, or tile it fully.
rooms with walls in the center. should leave at least 2 spaces on each side.

slime levels: lots of elliptical rooms. pools and streamers/trails of slime. fog or poison gas vents. enemy type: slimes or slug-men or something

hive levels: 3x3 rooms only, no doors. corridor numbers 4 4 1 4 4. GenerateInitial, then generate (50/50) rooms and corridor chains, 700 times. Do standard cleanup and verification. enemy type: some kind of insect, or hive dogs
	-no firepits, fire geysers, ....

fog levels: ???. lots of fog vents. enemy type: phantoms. (probably spawns 2-3 phantoms for every replaced monster)

mine levels: normal levels turned into caves. rubble. enemy type: kobolds.

fortress levels. big central hall, more ordered rooms and corridors. possibly symmetric.

opulent levels. lots of statues. pools of water? long (dead-end) halls?

more: moving parts? corridor features? carve rooms for chests in caves?





leveltype-specific monsters that can only appear in the proper "biome"

don't increase in power, but rather in number.


items you can only find on certain level types?



levelgen:
what sort of separations? would a level have only 2 'types'?
what about 'templates' in the form of functions that could be applied, like 'ruined'?



include a goal at the start	-	"None of the other scouts returned." etc


brutish strength
	-smash known traps, stalagmites, doors, statues. anything useful?
  no items, spells, or certain feats, but lots of damage and the ability to smash
  doors, statues, and other features?
explosive fungus orb-type item? or orcish grenades?


orc assassin? even more basic than the skulking killer? (but more dangerous because it sneak attacks.) Needs an AI enhancement: when moving toward the player, if there is a spot that the player can't see (but it's at the same distance as the spot you would have stepped to), step there to stay out of sight. shadowsight?

noxious worm
high hp. slow. breathes small clouds of poison every few turns. (could burrow into a wall and koolaid out when the player walks by. if it's a level 10 monster, it definitely should.)



new monsters:
undead fast animal - summoned by necro
slugman
  appears in groups. leaves slime trails on the ground. usually moves slowly, but
  moves quickly when on a slime trail. ranged attack, maybe?
(on-death triggers? light, knockback?)
(anything that doesn't care about how much damage you deal)


new dungeon features:
trapped chests or doors?
torches
	-implemented as walls that actually shed light from an adjacent tile?
alarms tied to items or doors?
periodic stun trap that affects everything in its LOS
bombable walls to hide some hidden rooms.
more open areas. maybe even LoL-style brush?
  open areas make carrying a torch more dangerous, and make lightning bolt better
beamos-inspired mob/trap/feature. probably mounted in the wall. might hit an
  entire direction instead of just a line.
round rooms
any other active dungeon elements or 'moving parts'
some other features that can be found in corridors.
deity statues. these would be colored instead of gray, and would have an associated event and terrain effect. the event simply checks the area and prints the appropriate descriptive message, then stops. the terrain effect depends on which type of statue it is. flat bonus to that skill? no, probably just set it to 10. that would lead to rooms where it's easy to hit & damage, rooms where it's hard to hit, rooms where magic is easy, rooms where magical/supernatural effects are diminished, and rooms where everything is stealthy. are there other good effects besides these?
anyway, these would appear near the center of rooms, and could replace the walls between shrines.
should rubble become nonopaque? that would allow me to put some along a corridor, making groups harder to fight there. (i could do it anyway, but the player would move it)
	-OTOH, if the player moves it, monsters don't have to. also, secret rooms can be here
One-way and/or single-use corridors. (thanks to .orphle. in #br.gue)
sometimes, monsters should actually guard corridors

other:
an event (possibly triggered by shrines or chests) where you defend an area for a
  short while, for some purpose.
light and dark sensitivity - i'm thinking blind-in-darkness and damaged-in-light.

considering a 'slimed' status that would put out fires but leave you clumsy or something. fire melts ice, ice freezes slime, slime douses fire. slime traps, slime enemies, slime orbs that you can employ to extinguish fires on yourself.
	-being on fire makes you immune to freezing, being frozen makes you immune to slime, and being slimed makes you immune to burning? sounds decent.
	-then i would add slime orb and orb of burning at the same time.
being slimed could give you a 50% chance to drop items rather than use them.

i think i've figured out slime:
	-any fire damage or catching fire breaks FROZEN.
	-any cold damage or being frozen breaks SLIMED.
	-FROZEN makes you immune to being SLIMED. SLIMED makes you immune to being on fire.
		being on fire makes you immune to being frozen.
	-walking on slime fails 1/3 of the time. The effect is identical to being stunned, 
		except that the message is "you slide" instead of "you stagger"
	-attacking on slime has a 1/3 chance of making you fall into the slime. this doesn't
		affect your attack, nor does it take time to stand up, but it SLIMES you.
	-while SLIMED, any item you try to use has a 50% chance to be dropped instead. evil!

probably split all these into 0.7.0 and 0.8.0.
then 0.9.0 can have special levels, and 1.0.0 will be the final iteration.
	-equipment update: better identities for weapons and armor. chainmail would resist slashing, 
		weapons would have different crit effects, plate would ... etc

		new terrain
		other balance changes
		and help check

-for the next version: item descriptions, slime and fog levels, leveltype-specific monsters, circular, diamond, and L-shaped rooms

in ForaysSuperClass: public ActorType ZOMBIE = ActorType.ZOMBIE;


things to do between 0.5 and 1.0:

at least 1 special level per game, with an appropriate number of different special levels
	-cave of bats

animations should support the concept of a 'viewer' - cells outside viewer's FOV don't animate.

generate trolls with rocks they can throw, in a lair, and have them stay in that lair.

consider making ranged attacks...not attacks at all, but generated straight from the AI routine

Select() needs a rewrite, and to be moved out of Actor.

mirrors: can be generated when there is solid rock behind a wall.
		-or, if I wanted to generate them anywhere, I could have a can_be_reflection thing.
			then what you see depends on where you stand.
	-they just show what is opposite them. doesn't show vampires. doesn't show the player's reflection 
		if the player is shadow cloaked.

partial classes to separate AI from the rest of Actor
foreach(int i in FourDirections) or foreach(int i in Dir8). 4, 8, and 9.

option to put stat window on right.

0.7.0 should have: (focus on gameplay)

"You are burned. You are unburnt." <--being attacked by burning enemy while Tough
think about scaling Spirit's duration reduction to more than 50%
what about a 'default ranged attack' in addition to the 'default melee attack' spell?
potion of vampirism? life drain, light allergy, flying. this would be a nice addition to an ID game, at least.
things other than the player should be able to call MakeNoise
extend the "monster notices" sounds so that you can hear them even if you can't see them.
	-this would make a good candidate for generalization: printing a message if the player can see an object OR if that object is within a certain distance. perhaps a distance that implies that the message is a sound, not a visual.


bugs: 
here's that really weird one where I got killed the turn I used a rune of time:
"Time stops for a moment. (grayed out)
You bring out your torch. The troll seer regenerates. The troll
seer casts glacial blast. The glacial blast hits you. You [more]
die. [more]"
minor: passage shows a WHITE floor under the player, not the correct color.
using lunge on an aware goblin archer a knight's move away. the archer appears normal, when it should have a green background from the targeting.
	-i believe this is another form of the other background color bug.
	-linux or win?
	-does not happen every time. this one might be a pain to track down.
again on linux - bits of the previous map still appear. no idea why. does not happen often. (once so far!)
	-not reproduced yet
"The skeleton looks less disoriented. " - no skeleton in sight.
	-reviewed code. should never happen, but it did.
		-theory: it died and the message was still printed. rework removal from msg_obj list.
			-happened again with "the skeleton looks more stable". debug the trap messages, then do the msg_obj fix.
		-above theory is probably wrong: happened with a goblin that was alive
"You fire an arrow. The arrow hits the cultist. The cultist [more]
dies."
	-note that the [more] takes up exactly as much space as "dies. " - what gives?
	-should be fixed!



--generate the list of monsters first, THEN generate the level. then verify that i.e. a troll has a proper lair.



room mimic
	-how is this going to work? perhaps it's usually generated at the end of a longish corridor, so blinking out is harder to do.
	-it shouldn't ACTUALLY prevent teleportation escapes, though. a quick Passage out is probably just the thing.
	-perhaps some kind of interactive 'don't stand here' thing.
	-so, the event checks every several turns to see if the player is within its area(which is the entire room)
	-if this happens, it either sets some state, or spawns another event type to check again a few turns later(remember, there's a chest in here)
		-how about a good chance of an extra item or two, as well?
			-EITHER 1d3 items OR a chest?
		-wait, why not trigger on the chest, also? both will work great.
	-when the mimic has been disturbed, a message is printed, the membrane/door starts to close, and acid starts to fall.
		-and some of the walls and floor turn to red?
	-i think the average distance from chest to door will be like 3, so probably 2d2 turns.
	-if the player is on the door when it closes, he takes some damage and becomes immobilized. (and can then escape)
	-otherwise, the door becomes a membrane (would be great if certain terrain had ATTACKABLE flag, yeah?) with an okay amount of HP.
	-all the while, every 1d3 turns acid drops onto the floor from the ceiling - this is delayed by 1 turn, so it doesn't hit the player directly.
		-lasts for 1d3+3 turns or so
	-standing in the acid deals damage, of course.
	-ALSO, to prevent the player from simply dancing around until he gets out...the room should probably either shrink, or be subject to an area attack.
		-a crushing attack is way easier. lowish damage, i suppose.
	-annnnd, when the player escapes, the membrane soon returns to its door form and the walls and floors to their normal colors.

	-first, i need terrain for acid and membrane, no problem.
	-and an event for 'spawn acid here', no prob
	-now, what state do i need to track? the event already tracks the area, no problem.
		-'player inside room' - the first trigger. unneeded if i trigger only on the chest.
		-state for 'disturbed', of course
		-'number of turns until membrane closes'
		-state for membrane: closing, crushing, closed.
		-'number of turns until next acid attack'
		-'number of turns until next crushing attack'
		-'membrane has been destroyed' - could also just mean it's dead, and remove the event.

idea for the cultist's special level: a receptacle fills as cultists die to fire damage. you don't want it to fill up.
idea for pangolin special level: giant pangolins tear open giant termite mounds. the pangolins use their armor to avoid harm as the termites swarm you.
battle of the titans special level: a brawl between titans that don't care about you. avoid being stepped on or destroyed by AOEs.
 <.agikm.> Maybe some wormlike creatures that would merge together and create more powerful variant of the same thing.
 <.agikm.> So you'd better just kill them one by one fast.
special level brainstorm idea dump:
skeleton jelly. hilarious.


voltaic rapture was too badass
-this spell wasn't voltaic rapture, but was lightning-based: each time you're hit in melee you release a radius 2 burst of electricity

trap disarming that simply requires different actions. One requires you to '.' wait on 2 opposite sides. One requires you to run around it without stopping. One requires you to step on all the diagonals without stepping on any of the cardinal directions.

BLOOD_MOTH		 -	25	-	3	bites		    (nothing)/"notices your light"
attracted to light, 
Found fluttering around any source of light, this huge moth is named for the rivulets of crimson on its wings that mimic dripping blood. Unlike most moths, it has a wide razor-filled mouth.
SWORDSMAN		40	35	3	2	hits			-
ready to duel, eyes watch (your) movements, twirls his sword in his hand, 
Always ready for a fight, the swordsman twirls his sword in his hand as he walks. His eyes never leave his foe, watching for the next advance.
SKULKING_KILLER		40	35	3	3	hits			-
leaping/dashing/? from shadow to shadow, blade in hand, grin or grimace, 
This rogue dashes from shadow to shadow, dagger in hand. A smirk appears as the killer overtakes the victim.
ROBED_ZEALOT		40	40	3	3	hammers			-
holy symbol, holy magic, church's spells, heretics, 
A holy symbol hangs, silver and forked, from the neck of the zealot. The holy magic of the church's spells promises the zealot a swift victory over heretics.
SHADOW			45	40	2	2	touches			-
manifest darkness, not quite entirely solid, visible in light, 
Shadows are manifest darkness, barely maintaining a physical presence. A dark environment hides them utterly, but the light reveals their warped human shape.
BANSHEE			40	40	2	2	claws			-
Claws are blood-caked nails, the length of your entire hand, face full of pain and hate, (wisp/shred/?) dress hangs/floats/flies behind her, scream, 
The banshee's face is full of pain and hate. Blood-caked nails
The banshee floats shrieking, trailing wisps of a faded dress behind her. Her nails are blood-caked claws. The banshee's hateful scream is painful for the living to hear.
WARG			40	40	2	2	bites			-
more intelligent relative of the wolf, white fur with black markings, eyes too human, 
This wolf has white fur with black markings. Its eyes are too human for your liking.
PHASE_SPIDER		50	45	1*	1*	bites			-
noneuclidean, seems to climb into solid surfaces, dripping fangs, even when looking at it, you think you can hear it behind you, 
Heedless of the laws of nature, this brilliantly iridescent spider steps to the side and appears twenty feet away. Even when you're looking right at it, you think you can hear it behind you.
ASCETICMONK_		 -	40	-	3	punches/kicks/strikes	"babbles incoherently"
mad, flurry, skilled, mad rambling, you can only do the same,
