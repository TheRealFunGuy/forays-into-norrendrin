things to do between 0.5 and 1.0:

20 dungeon levels, with an appropriate number of monsters and items

at least 1 special level per game, with an appropriate number of different special levels

animations should support the concept of a 'viewer' - cells outside viewer's FOV don't animate.


things to do somewhere between 0.1 and 1.0:
...
...



20 monsters +
troll
necromancer
cultist
	-something for cultists to summon - this should be on a special level though, and it would be badass.
		-summoning circles and all
poltergeist (uncommon)
	-throws objects, slams doors(which the player will hear and investigate), shrieks, ...
	-if you stay in its area for a certain amount of time, it manifests:
		-gray or green 'G'
		-i want it to retain some of its annoying qualities. perhaps a short period of time where it moves randomly and
			is hard to hit or damage for some reason. oh, it should laugh while doing this of course.
		

something that uses 'double team' and spawns one or more clones with 1hp each and the NO_EXP flag.
what's appropriate? a magic-using member of a brutish race? a ninja? a human of some kind?
	-perhaps a fairly dynamic ninja-esque enemy, then. Somewhat fast. Single-use thrown item that can stun(?) you during its approach. Uses double team (once) when damaged.
	-can't actually be a ninja without stealth, though. maybe a mystic or monk? (would probably change the thrown item part)
