bugs: 

here's that really weird one where I got killed the turn I used a rune of time:
"Time stops for a moment. (grayed out)
You bring out your torch. The troll seer regenerates. The troll
seer casts glacial blast. The glacial blast hits you. You [more]
die. [more]"

visual bug for lightning bolt: when targeting past the target to hit it at an angle (when it's in a doorway, say), the bolt seems to go through walls.

"The skeleton looks less disoriented. " - no skeleton in sight.
	-reviewed code. should never happen, but it did.
		-theory: it died and the message was still printed. rework removal from msg_obj list.
			-happened again with "the skeleton looks more stable". debug the trap messages, then do the msg_obj fix.
		-above theory is probably wrong: happened with a goblin that was alive
			-yeah, this still happens. maybe the bug is in the 'forget about dead things' code in event.
