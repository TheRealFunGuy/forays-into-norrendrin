(Forays into Norrendrin is a roguelike game. Don't know what a

How to play:

Important commands to remember are 'e' to examine and change
your equipment, and 'a' to use your consumable items.
If your health drops, press 'r' to rest - but only once per
level!


Your torch illuminates your surroundings, but also gives away
your position. If you wish to avoid notice, put away your
torch with 't'. ('t' will also bring it back out again.)


Press tab to look at your surroundings. (Pressing escape or
space will exit most menus and selections.)


If you've learned a spell, you can cast it by pressing 'z'. 


You can view and activate feats from the character screen 'c'.
(Some feats are activated, while some are entirely passive.)


Try switching to your bow and firing some arrows('e' to switch,
's' to shoot). You always have access to five different weapons
and three different armors. 


Remember that you don't need to kill every enemy you encounter.
Some enemies - mostly humanoids - can carry consumable items,
though.


When you find stairs, you can walk down them with '>'. (It's a
one-way trip, so don't leave anything behind!)


Press 'f' now to switch to the command help page. (The command
list can be accessed directly in-game by pressing '-'.)
