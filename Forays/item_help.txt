Potions:

Potion of healing - This invaluable elixir will instantly
  restore you to full health.

Potion of regeneration - The potent healing magic in this
  potion will steadily grant you health for 100 turns.

Potion of stoneform - This potion will change you temporarily
  to unliving stone, granting a slight resistance to all
  damage. You'll no longer be able to catch fire,
  and no toxin, gas, or potion will affect you.

Potion of vampirism - Consuming this potion will grant many of
  the powers of a true vampire. You'll fly and drain life from
  living enemies, but light will leave you vulnerable.

Potion of brutish strength - Drinking this potion grants the
  strength of a juggernaut. For a short time you'll be able to
  smash through various dungeon features. Additionally, your
  attacks will deal maximum damage and knock foes back 5
  spaces, and you'll keep moving afterward if possible.

Potion of roots - Drinking this potion will cause thick roots
  to grow from you, holding you tightly to the ground and
  providing defense against attacks.

Potion of haste - Drinking this potion will double your
  movement speed and greatly enhance your reflexes. You'll
  sometimes dodge an attack by leaping to a nearby space.
  You're more likely to dodge in an open area, but be careful
  around dangerous terrain.

Potion of silence - This potion will cause you to radiate an
  aura of silence, preventing all sounds within 2 spaces. This
  can help you remain stealthy, but leaves you unable to speak
  words of magic.

Potion of cloaking - This potion will cover you in shadows, 
  causing you to fade to invisibility while in darkness.

Potion of mystic mind - This potion will expand your mind,
  allowing you to sense foes no matter where they are, and
  granting immunity to stuns, sleep, rage, confusion, and fear.

  of fire, just far enough to avoid its heat...if you stand
  still.

  gas, causing those affected to move and attack in random

Wand of dust storm - When zapped, this wand creates a billowing
  cloud of thick blinding dust, so heavy that it can extinguish
  flames.

  invisible. Carrying a light source (or being on fire) will
  still reveal an invisible being's location.

  attack at range (with your current weapon) against your

  you can throw it forcefully. You can throw items, monsters,
  terrain features, and even yourself.
