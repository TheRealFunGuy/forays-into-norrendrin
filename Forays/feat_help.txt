Combat feats:

Quick draw - Switch from a melee weapon to another weapon
             instantly. (You can fire arrows without first
             switching to your bow. However, putting your bow
             away still takes time.)

Whirlwind style - When you take a step, you automatically
                  attack every enemy still adjacent to you.

Lunge - Leap from one space away and attack your target with
        perfect accuracy. The intervening space must be
        unoccupied.

Drive back - Enemies must yield ground in order to avoid your
             attacks. (If your target has nowhere to run, your
             attacks will automatically hit.)



Defense feats:

Armor mastery - When your armor blocks an enemy's attack,
                you're twice as likely to score a critical hit
                on it next turn. The exhaustion total at which
                armor becomes too heavy is increased by 25%.

Cunning dodge - Relying on mobility and tricks, you can
                entirely avoid the first attack of each foe
                you face.

Deflect attack - When an enemy attacks you, you might deflect
                 the attack to another enemy (one that is
                 adjacent to both you and your attacker).

Tumble - Move up to two spaces while avoiding arrows. Takes two
         turns to perform.



Magic feats:

Master's edge - The first offensive spell you've learned will
                deal 1d6 extra damage. (Affects the first spell
                in the list that deals damage directly.)

Arcane interference - When you cast a spell, nearby enemies
                      lose their ability to cast that spell.
                      If this happens, your spells will be
                      empowered for several turns.

Chain casting - The mana cost of your spells is reduced by one
                if you cast a spell last turn. (This doesn't
                ever reduce mana costs to zero.)

Force of will - Exhaustion will never make you fail an attempt
                at casting. (Casting without mana still
                increases your exhaustion.)



Spirit feats:

Conviction - Each turn you're engaged in combat (attacking or
             being attacked) you gain 1 bonus Spirit, and
             bonus Combat skill equal to half that.

Enduring soul - Your health recovers over time. You'll regain
                one HP every five turns until your total health
                is a multiple of 10.

Feel no pain - When your health becomes very low (less than
               20%), you briefly enter a state of
               invulnerability. (For about 5 turns, you'll be
               immune to damage, but not other effects.)

Boiling blood - Taking damage briefly increases your movement
                speed. (This effect can stack up to 5 times.
                At 5 stacks, your speed is doubled.)



Stealth feats:

Neck snap - Automatically perform a stealth kill when attacking
            an unaware medium humanoid. (Living enemies of
            approximately human size.)

Disarm trap - Alter a trap so that you can walk past it safely
              (but enemies still trigger it). You can use this
              feat again to disable it entirely.

Corner climb - If you're in a corner (and in the dark), enemies
               can't see you unless they're adjacent to you.

Danger sense - Once you've seen or detected an enemy, you can
               sense where it's safe and where that enemy might
               detect you. Your torch must be extinguished
               while you're sneaking.
